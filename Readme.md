## Summary:
In knowledge-based economies, many businesses enterprises defy traditional industry boundaries.  Therefore, we can no longer rely on traditional industry/sector codes to identify peers for a company. This project studies in depth a 'wisdom of crowd' peer identification method called Analyst Cocoverage Peers and show that it outperforms industry peer groups, producing stronger residual and fundamental variable correlation.

## Aside:
Code is not shown in the repository because of Non Disclosure Agreement
